# 🌦️ OpenWeather Current Data Pull-Up

**Date:** 31st October 2025  
**Author:** Benjamin Ishimwe  

## 📝 Description
This project demonstrates how to use the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data for selected cities.  
The retrieved data is processed in Python, converted into a Pandas DataFrame, and visualized in a mock dashboard.
## 🎯 PROJECT OBJECTIVES
- **Set up API Access:** Register on the OpenWeather platform and generate an API key for accessing weather data.
- **Fetch Current Weather Data:** Use Python to send requests to the OpenWeather API and collect real-time weather information.
- **Data Handling with Pandas:** Convert API responses into structured Pandas DataFrames for analysis.
- **Mock Dashboard Creation:** Use Claude AI or ChatGPT to design a prototype dashboard that visualizes weather insights.
- **Documentation:** Record and explain the entire process for reproducibility and learning purposes.
 
This project is a beginning of building a data pipeline. It consists of pulling weather data conditions of various cities from Open weather platform. Convert them to data frame using python/pandas.

## 🌍 Data Source
- **OpenWeather:** [https://openweathermap.org/guide](https://openweathermap.org/guide)

## 🧭 Methodology
a) Explored OpenWeather’s free plans and registered for an API key.  
b) Used the **`requests`** module in Python to fetch current weather data for ten major African cities.  
c) Structured the retrieved data into a **Pandas DataFrame** for easy manipulation and analysis.  
d) Created **bar charts** with **Matplotlib** to visually compare the cities’ temperature levels.

## 📊 Results
The analysis revealed that:
- **Kinshasa**, **Abuja**, and **Dakar** recorded the **highest temperatures** among the selected cities.  
- Other cities showed moderate or relatively lower temperature levels at the time of data retrieval.

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**  
- **Requests** (for API calls)  
- **Pandas** (for data processing)  
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)
